# Zen Zielke | Conversation & Character Designer

> **"Designing the logic of language and the character of systems."**

This repository hosts the portfolio of **Zen Zielke**, a Graduate Student (M.S., Johns Hopkins), Novelist, and Poet. The site demonstrates a multidisciplinary approach to writing and design, merging the rigor of **Systems Engineering** with the nuance of **Writing**.

## 📂 Project Overview

This portfolio is built to be lightweight and typographically focused, mirroring the design philosophy of high-fidelity system interfaces. It showcases six distinct competencies:

### 1. Creative Writing: System Persona Design
**Project:** *No More Horses* (Novel)
Demonstrating the creation of distinct verbal frameworks based on character constraints.
* **High Constraint:** Trauma-informed syntax (silence/control).
* **Low Constraint:** Safety-informed syntax (rhetorical warmth).

### 2. Technical Communication: Academic Rigor
**Project:** *Strategic Behavior in Quantum Game Theory* (Research Paper)
Beyond implementation, this section proves the ability to document complex technical systems. It features the formal analysis of the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein (EWL) protocol implemented in Python/Qiskit.

### 3. Spatial Design: Generative Materiality
**Project:** *Aether* (visionOS Prototype)
Moving text off the 2D screen and into 3D material space. This case study explores how UI microcopy reacts to the "physics" of the system (e.g., variable blur radius based on weather data).

### 4. Sensory Design: Atmosphere & Vibe
**Project:** *The Crypt* (Editorial)
Capturing the sensory experience of physical spaces. Used to demonstrate the ability to write for lifestyle, music, or editorial contexts where mood and culture are paramount.

### 5. Tone & Philosophy: The "Why"
**Project:** *If Everything Ends...* (Script)
Managing user anxiety through tone. This script uses direct address and humor to guide users through complex philosophical concepts (existentialism/entropy) without inducing cognitive overload.

### 6. Economy of Language: Constraint-Based Writing
**Project:** *Selected Poetry*
A collection of poetry ("Marrow," "Frost," "Coal") demonstrating the ultimate exercise in economy of language—delivering maximum emotional impact with minimum character count.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **Tailwind CSS (via CDN):** Utility-first styling used to replicate a specific "Glass/Dark Mode" aesthetic without heavy build steps.
* **GitHub Pages:** Static hosting.
